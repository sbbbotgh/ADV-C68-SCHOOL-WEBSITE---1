            <h4>Welcome to Chinmaya International Residential School</h4>

            <p>We build upon the basis that the future of our world rests upon the quality of its youth. Quality comes through care and attention. In having to raise children of quality and purpose, to make them the kind of citizens the world needs so much today than ever before, we have to educate children not just with instructions but train them in that direction with all the attention and care they deserve.
                <br>
                <br>
                Never before in our national history did the best minds of India move out in such spectacular numbers to serve communities in distant foreign lands, living amidst unusual climates, strange food habits, peculiar social customs and confusing cultural environments. Everywhere young Indians are scoring success with their performances in science and technology, commerce and art. We salute them for all their excellence and wish them even greater success in their professions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Those who have gone abroad with their families try to contribute their Indian way of life with the lifestyle of their adopted countries. At times such attempts create pressures and conflicts over moral values and cultural patterns. The children see one thing at home and meet contradictory situations outside. Because of this bi-cultural experience they run the risk of picking up attitudes potentially dangerous and sometimes suicidal to their future happiness and success.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am glad my suggestions are now fully accepted both in India and abroad. CIRS will provide an environment that will help integrate the best of each culture. It will be a cultural home away from home for our growing children.
                <br>
                <br>
                Send us your children. Let them have one to six years of cultural adventure during their 11-18 years of age. Let us give them a chance to understand and absorb Indian culture and heritage and return to the countries from where they came, to continue their studies. Let us build up sufficient knowledge and taste in them to feel a sense of identity with and a pride in their Indian heritage.

            <h4>INDIVIDUAL CARE</h4>
            <p>CIRS is not just a school, it is a family. Each child is given individual attention, just as they would get at home. Many schools only meet the child's intellectual needs. But at CIRS, all the needs of the child are met with understanding and appropriate care, be it physical, emotional, intellectual or spiritual.
                <br>
                <br>
                The result is a school where the students are bright, confident and balanced individuals, in work and play. They cherish the love and nurturing which they receive and they respond positively. Many students comment that they feel as much a part of CIRS as they feel with their family at home.
                <br>
                <br>
                At CIRS, the child is not just a statistic or a roll number. Each individual is given importance, and their worth is appreciated. Each child's birthday is a celebration, with a special song (written by Guruji) at the school assembly and once in 15 days a great celebration for birthdays. The atmosphere at CIRS is homely and loving. The staff and management genuinely care for the children, and for each other, and this shows.

            <h4>ACADEMIC SUCCESS</h4>
            <p>CIRS achieves excellent exam results by being dedicated to excellence in all areas and by encouraging students to work hard and do well. The teachers at CIRS are constantly motivating and inspiring students to give their 100% to all that they do. The spiritual curriculum in particular keeps the students grounded and well-prepared for studying enthusiastically and achieving top results.
                <br>
                <br>
                Relatively small class sizes allow the teachers to give individual attention to the students and ample support in the evenings too. The children get regular feedback and guidance from their teachers and their progress is carefully monitored. Parents' are also given the opportunity to discuss their child's academic development.
                <br>
                <br>
                The school library is visited regularly by all students. It has an impressive collection of academic and reference books, as well as journals and periodicals. Outside the library in the courtyard there are national and international newspapers on display so that students can get the most up-to-date information on current affairs. To improve students' vocabulary and broaden their horizons, the library also has a wide selection of fiction books. It also boasts of a wonderful collection of spiritual books from the Chinmaya Mission as well as other organizations, covering all faiths. The library offers the students a quiet and peaceful place for study, research and recreation, and it is central to the academic life of the school.
                <br>
                <br>
                The academic success of CIRS students has taken them to excellent colleges and universities in India and abroad, in preparation for successful and dynamic careers. Faculty members are always available to provide information and guidance to the students about higher education and careers. Public speaking and giving presentations form part of the academic curriculum and these are skills which are useful when applying to colleges and universities. CIRS receives prospectuses from the best of national and international institutes every year for the senior students to plan their applications for further education.
